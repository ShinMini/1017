# Goals

1. build machine learning application on React Native
2. using expo(not using used to native-cli), build both of android and ios platform
3. build the ML model with tensorflow

# Focus on

1. using mobile pysical camera feature
2. get photoes and videos from user's library
3. chacing data at assets directory about requirement data to build application (fonts, background image... etc)    
4. running tensorflow on mobile device with React Native application
5. tailor data from user library to compactable tensorflow library
6. predict result with tailored image data with tensor model
7. display result data with UI for user
